## What is voca?

Web app for learning english vocabulary.
Created quickly to serve its private purpose. Don't learn to code from this project :) it could be really much much better

## Why it exists?

Cause my wife asked me to create it for her. There couldn't be any better reason.

## Vocabulary

My wife adds vocabulary entries, so if you have some issues there, I'll tell her to fix it :)
